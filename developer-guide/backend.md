# Developer Guide - Backend

SAS code is compiled, built & deployed using the SASjs CLI.

Using the CLI provides a lot of benefits:

* Self contained web services (no code is used from the server filesystem)
* Test framework for Jobs, Services and Macros
* Auto-generated documentation
* Automated deployment

The following software should be installed on your local machine in order to commence development:

* [VS Code](https://sasjs.io/windows/#vscode)
* [GIT](https://sasjs.io/windows/#git)
* [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)
* [SASjs CLI](https://cli.sasjs.io/installation)

The following resources may also be studied, to understand the nuances of SASjs:
