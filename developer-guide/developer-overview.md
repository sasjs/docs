# Developer Guide - Overview

This section covers development and testing.  Before commencing development, you first need to set up your deployment (and target).  For this, see the [admin guide](/admin-guide/admin-overview).

The rest of this guide is split between:

* [Frontend](/developer-guide/frontend)
* [Backend](/developer-guide/backend)
* [Testing](/developer-guide/testing)
* [Documentation](/developer-guide/documentation)
