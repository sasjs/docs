# Developer Guide - Frontend

The frontend is built using the React framework, and is based on the SASjs React Seed app: [https://github.com/sasjs/react-seed-app](https://github.com/sasjs/react-seed-app).

The first build can be generated using `npm run build` however for subsequent builds, use `npm build-react` (which avoids the need to recompile the documentation).

All communication with SAS is made through the SASjs Adapter which is documented [here](https://adapter.sasjs.io).
