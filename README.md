# SASjs Docs

This repo is a template documentation site for use in the various SASjs seed apps.

It is embedded into each repo as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) - meaning that the source can be maintained in one place.

When creating apps using the [SASjs create](https://cli.sasjs.io/create/) command, the submodule is cloned, and the link broken, for ease of use.
