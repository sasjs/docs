# SASjs Docs

This repo is a template documentation site, which provides a suggested user / developer / admin guide for all SASjs seed apps.  You can view the live version here:  https://sasjs.github.io/docs/

The README file (which you are now reading) is the homepage.  Describe your project here!

The site makes use of Docsify - documentation is [here](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify).

Some nice things about Docsify:

1.  It runs with strict CSP.  To achieve this, we have put the external assets in this folder: `static/assets` 
2.  It runs as a static site - meaning nothing to compile, no need for NPM.
3.  You write your docs in markdown (easy)
4.  Search capability
5.  It's FOSS!
